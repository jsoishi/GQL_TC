\begin{abstract}
Taylor-Couette flow is well known to admit a spiral turbulence state in which laminar and turbulent patches coexist around the cylinder. This flow state is quite complex, with delicate internal structure, and it can be traced into certain regimes of linear stability. This behaviour is believed to be connected to the non-normality of the linear operator, which is itself a function of the control parameters. Using spiral turbulence in both linearly stable and unstable regimes, we investigate the effectiveness of the generalised quasilinear approximation (GQL), an extension of quasilinear theory designed to capture the essential aspects of turbulent flows. We find that GQL performs much better in the supercritical regime than the subcritical. By including only a small number of modes into the non-linear interactions, GQL simulations maintain a turbulent-like state when in the supercritical regime. However, a much larger number is required to avoid returning to the laminar state when in the subcritical regime.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Since Taylor's classic 1923 paper\cite{1923RSPTA.223..289T}, fluid between two independently rotating cylinders has become a rich laboratory for the understanding of instability, transition to turbulence, and turbulence itself. Indeed, the interplay between experiment, computation, and theoretical understanding evinced in Taylor's paper remains a model for the study of fluid dynamics.

Some of the most common forms of turbulence in nature are anisotropic, with a symmetry broken by rotation, magnetic fields, or boundary effects. In these situations, significant theoretical progress can be made by considering \emph{quasi-linear} (QL) models, in which one retains only those non-linearities that interact with the mean flow. Recently, the generalised quasi-linear approximation (GQL) has been developed to systematically expand the QL idea to include sets of non-linear interactions between two \emph{sets} of modes, low and high, respectively (see \cite{2022arXiv220505513M} for a recent review). GQL has been shown to perform significantly better in reproducing direct numerical simulations (DNS) than QL models across a wide range of paradigm flows including forced zonal jet formation \cite{2016PhRvL.116u4501M}, rotating plane Couette flow \cite{2017JFM...810..412T}, rapidly rotating convection \cite{2018RSPSA.47480422T}, and channel flow\cite{2019Kellam, 2022JFM...936A..33H, 2022JFM...944A..34H}.

Here, we consider Taylor-Couette (TC) flows at moderate inner and outer Reynolds numbers, $|\Reyn_{i,o}| < 3500$. This is an interesting test bed for GQL because it features numerous intricate patterns that are maintained by non-linear interactions beyond the cascade, local in coefficient space, found at high $\Reyn$. 
One of the key features of TC flow is that it has non-linear and linear instabilities in different regions of parameter space. In the linearly stable regions, transient growth has been observed in TC flow\cite{2002PhFl...14.3475H, 2002PhFl...14.1655M}. 
We can write the Navier-Stokes equations in schematic form as
\begin{equation}
    \label{eqn:NS-schematic}
    \frac{\partial \mathbf{q}}{\partial t} + \Lop \mathbf{q} = \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{q}),
\end{equation}
where $\Lop$ is a linear operator and $\mathcal{N}$ is a non-linear function of the state vector $\mathbf{q} = \left[ \mathbf{u},  p\right]^T$, where $\mathbf{u}$ is the velocity field and $p$ the pressure.
As noted by \cite{2002PhFl...14.3475H}, the non-normality of the linear operator $\Lop$ for TC flow is a function of its control parameters.
That is, its commutator with its adjoint
\begin{equation}
    [\Lop^\dagger, \Lop] = f(\mu, \eta, \Reyn_i, \Gamma)
\end{equation}
can be zero or non-zero, and $f$ is a function of the four parameters of Taylor-Couette flow: the inner cylinder Reynolds number $\Reyn_i$, the ratio of inner to outer radii $\eta \equiv R_i/R_o$, the ratio of outer to inner rotation rates $\mu \equiv \Omega_o/\Omega_i$, and the aspect ratio of the cylinder $\Gamma \equiv L_z/d$. 
This provides a very useful arena to test the validity of GQL in a system that admits a varying degree of non-normality.

As a first experiment to this end, we consider the \emph{spiral turbulence} flow regime. The classic paper by Coles \cite{1965JFM....21..385C} was the first to note a hysteretic transition to spiral turbulence when the cylinders were counter-rotating: an experiment at fixed $\Reyn_o$ will have spiral turbulence at a certain $\Reyn_i$ if $\Reyn_i$ is reached by \emph{decreasing} from a higher value, but will not have spiral turbulence at the same $\Reyn_i$ if it is reached by \emph{increasing} from a lower value. More recent work has identified both supercritical and subcritical paths to spiral turbulence\cite{2009PhRvE..80d6315M}. In that work, the authors follow spiral turbulence along a decreasing $\Reyn_i$ path and show that the state is maintained even below the linear stability boundary when $\Reyn_o = -3000$ but it relaminarises below the stability boundary when $\Reyn_o = -1200$.
Using \cite{2009PhRvE..80d6315M} as a guide, we use direct numerical simulations (DNS) at $\Reyn_o = -3398$ and decrease $\Reyn_i$ into the subcritical region. We then run a suite of GQL simulations in both the super- and subcritical regions.

We begin in section~\ref{sec:methods} by detailing our equations, non-dimensionalisation, and numerical methods. Section~\ref{sec:linear} reviews both modal and non-modal linear analyses of spiral turbulence. In section~\ref{sec:nonlinear}, we describe the main results of the paper, the comparison of DNS, QL, and GQL for supercritical and subcritical spiral turbulence. Finally, we offer discussion and concluding remarks in section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
%Recently, a subcritical transition to turbulence via interpenetrating spirals has been reported \cite{2020JFM...892A..12C}. This work has a small aspect ratio $\Gamma = 5.26$, which delays the onset of linear instability to considerably higher $\Reyn_1$ for a given $\Reyn_2$. 

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}
We solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with unit density for $\mathbf{u}' = \mathbf{u} - \mathbf{U}$,
where $\mathbf{U} = A r + B/r \hat{\mathbf{e}}_\phi$ is circular Couette flow (CCF) and $A$ and $B$ are the standard constants (see \cite{Chandra1961}, chapter 7),
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:NS}
      \frac{\partial \mathbf{u'}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'} + \mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{U} + \mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'} &= -\nabla p + \nu \nabla^2\mathbf{u'}\\
      \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u'} &= 0,
\end{align}
where $p$ is the pressure and $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity.
We solve equations~\ref{eqn:NS} without modification for the DNS runs.
To briefly review, GQL extends the quaslinear approximation by dividing
 $\mathbf{u'}$ into two subsets,
\begin{align}
    \mathbf{u'}_l = \left< \mathbf{u'}\right>_l &= \sum_{m = -\Lambda_\theta}^{\Lambda_\theta} \sum_{k = -\Lambda_z}^{\Lambda_z} \mathbf{\hat{u}'}_{mk}(r) e^{i (m \theta + 2\pi k z/L_z)}\\
    \mathbf{u'}_h = \mathbf{u'} - \mathbf{u'}_l,
\end{align}
which we refer to as the ``low'' and ``high'' modes, respectively.
$\Lambda_z$ and $\Lambda_\theta$ are adjustable parameters that represent the \emph{cutoff} in wavenumber space delineating low from high. 
The non-linearity, when expressed in spectral space is a triadic interaction between wavenumbers. GQL includes all such interactions that fall into three classes: low-low $\to$ low, high-high $\to$ low, and low-high $\to$ high, and it discards all others.
This is a closed system that respects all conservation laws of the original equations \cite{2016PhRvL.116u4501M}.
Most importantly, it represents a systematic closure of increasing fidelity independent of a particular theoretical model for the underlying turbulence.

We introduce a projection operator to perform this division, in which case
GQL can be written as 
\begin{align}
\label{eqn:GQL}
      \frac{\partial \mathbf{u'}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{U} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'} + \mathbf{u'} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{U} +\nabla p - \nu \nabla^2\mathbf{u'} = &- \left<\mathbf{u'}_l \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'}_l +\mathbf{u'}_h \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'}_h\right>_l\\
      & +\left<\mathbf{u'}_l \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'}_h + \mathbf{u'}_h \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u'}_l \right>_h\\
      \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u'} = & 0,
\end{align}
where we have written all linear terms on the left hand side. This form is equivalent to those given in prior works (for example \cite{2017JFM...810..412T}), where separate equations are written for the low and high modes, respectively.

We non-dimensionalise lengths in terms of the gap width $d = R_2 - R_1$ and velocities in terms of the inner cylinder velocity $U_i = R_i \Omega_i$. In our computations, the $z$ direction is periodic and thus $L_z$ is the periodicity length. We will also refer to the two Reynolds numbers $\Reyn_i$, $\Reyn_o$, related by
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\Reyn_o}{\Reyn_i} = \frac{\mu}{\eta}.
\end{equation}
It is also quite useful to characterise times in terms of the viscous diffusion time $\tau_\nu \equiv d^2/\nu$. In our units, $\tau_\nu = \Reyn_i$.

In our simulations, the possible spiral patterns are quantised by the periodicity in $z$ and $\theta$. Figure~\ref{fig:urms_tz_rei700} shows that for $\Reyn_i = 700$, the pattern selected has $k_z = m = 1$; $\Reyn_i = 900$ has the same pattern (not shown). Given this pattern, it is unclear a priori how to select the cutoff wavenumbers: unlike the case of plane Couette flow, where a self-sustaining process involving a quasilinear transfer of streamwise waves to spanwise/wall-normal rolls is well established, here we have a turbulent structure that is bounded in both $z$ and $\theta$. 
Given this lack of apparent directionality, for all runs in this paper, $\Lambda = \Lambda_z = \Lambda_\theta$, though we note it would be interesting to consider models with varying $\Lambda_\theta$  but $\Lambda_z = N_z$, where $N_z$ is the DNS resolution. Such models are fully non-linear in $z$ and thus generalise the quasilinear \emph{restricted non-linear} models used with success in shear flow turbulence \cite{2014PhFl...26j5112T, 2015PhFl...27j5104T, 2015PhFl...27a1702B}.

We use the pseudo-spectral Dedalus framework (version 2) \cite{2020PhRvR...2b3068B} for all linear and non-linear calculations. We discretize the three velocity components and pressure onto a basis of Chebyshev polynomials in the radial direction, while $\theta$ and $z$ use Fourier bases.
To evolve the solution forward in time, we use the implicit-explicit Runga-Kutta RK443 time stepper; linear terms are implicitly timestepped while non-linear terms are explicit.
Our initial value solver has been extensively tested for TC flow against the linear and non-linear test cases in \cite{1984JFM...146...45M, 1984JFM...146...65M} including linear growth rates, non-linear wave speeds, and torque measurements; our spiral turbulence DNS results also agree with those in \cite{2009PhRvE..80d6315M,2009PhRvE..80f7301D,2011JFM...668..150D}. 
Resolutions and geometric parameters for all runs are given in table~\ref{tab:simulations}.

We have confirmed our simulations are resolved by ensuring that the highest wavenumber components have spectral power at least $10^5$ smaller than the most energetic scale.

Pseudospectra and critical parameters are calculated using eigentools \cite{2021JOSS....6.3079O}.

\section{Linear Stability}
\label{sec:linear}
In order to determine the linear stability bound, we find the minimum $\Reyn_i$ for a given $\Reyn_o$ by solving the eigenvalue problem for equations~\ref{eqn:NS}. We note that for all $\Reyn_o$ plotted in figure~\ref{fig:LSB}, the most unstable mode is never axisymmetric. At $\Reyn_o=-3398$, where our non-linear calculations are run, the most unstable mode has $m = 6$ at onset. Figure~\ref{fig:LSB} also shows the hysteresis boundaries given in references \cite{1986JFM...164..155A} and \cite{1965JFM....21..385C}. In both cases, original tabular data was not available, so we extracted the data from figures 16 and 2a, respectively using WebPlotDigitizer \cite{Rohatgi2020}. The error bars on the Coles (1965) \cite{1965JFM....21..385C} data give the top and bottom of the markers from the original paper. We note in passing that the two studies do not agree on the lower boundary for hysteresis despite similar experimental geometries. Our subcritical experiment is within the more conservative hysteresis boundary given by reference \cite{1986JFM...164..155A}.
\begin{figure}

(1986) and Coles (1965) give the boundaries of spiral turbulence hysteresis reported in those two papers.}
    \label{fig:LSB}
\end{figure}
The spiral turbulence regime provides an ideal opportunity to test GQL in an environment with both spatiotemporal patterns and a tunable bifurcation: by choosing $\Reyn_i$ and $\Reyn_o$ appropriately, both subcritical and supercritical manifestations of spiral turbulence can be selected.

Following pioneering numerical work \cite{2009PhRvE..79c6309M, 2009PhRvE..80d6315M}, we set the outer cylinder rotation rate to $\Reyn_o = -3398$ and
%for the subcritical path and $\Reyn_o = -1359$ for the supercritical path and 
start a DNS run at $\Reyn_i = 900$, high enough to trigger spiral turbulence driven by linear instability from a low-amplitude, random initial condition satisfying $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = 0$.
From this seed run, we decrease $\Reyn_i$ in steps shown in figure~\ref{fig:LSB} where each point represents a DNS or GQL simulation run for one viscous time. The solid circles in figure~\ref{fig:LSB} represent runs where we performed GQL analyses. 

In order to demonstrate the effects non-normality plays, figure~\ref{fig:pseudospectra} shows both the modal spectrum (in blue points) and the $\epsilon-$pseudospectrum for the supercritical and subcritical $\Reyn_i$. The contour value $\log_{10} \epsilon^{-1}$ represents the set of values 
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:pseudospectrum}
    \lVert (z \mathbf{I} - \Lop)^{-1} \rVert \geq \epsilon^{-1}
\end{equation}
for a given complex number $z = \gamma + i\omega$. The spectrum {$\sigma$} are the eigenvalues corresponding to the temporal evolution of a linear solution, $e^{\sigma t}$ (see \cite{trefethen2005spectra} for an introduction). Equation~\ref{eqn:pseudospectrum} depends on the choice of norm; here we use the standard energy norm. These contours in turn give a measure of the maximum amplification of a linear disturbance: the further negative contours extend into the upper-half plane, the larger a linear disturbance can grow as a result of non-normality, irrespective of the presence of instability. This linear effect is captured entirely by GQL (and QL, for that matter). However, the role it plays in the development of subcritical spiral turbulence remains an open question, as the relevant linear operator $\Lop$ in the subcritical case is not that associated with circular Couette flow $\mathbf{U}$. Instead, any transient growth is generated by the saturated mean velocity profile.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:nonlinear}
Figure~\ref{fig:urms_tz_rei700} shows a typical DNS snapshot of the RMS velocity perturbation $u'_{rms}$ in the middle of the gap for $\Reyn_i=700$. Despite being well below the linear stability threshold $\Reyn_{i,crit} \simeq 778$, the flow morphology is nearly identical to the supercritical case $\Reyn_i = 900$ (not shown).

    \label{fig:urms_tz_rei700}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Supercritical Spiral Turbulence}
We first consider the supercritical case with $\Reyn_i = 900$. We initialise GQL simulations with $\Lambda = 0, 1, 3, 5, 10, 30, 60$ using a snapshot of DNS data at $t \simeq 1.5 \tau_\nu$.  Figure~\ref{fig:rei900_snapshots} shows slices at mid-gap, $r = R_{mid}$. The first important thing to note is that low-order models are not able to maintain the spiral structure until $\Lambda \geq 30$. However, even including a single additional low mode, $\Lambda = 1$, shows a significant increase in flow complexity compared to QL. It is quite interesting to note that QL \emph{does} feature some degree of spatial intermittency--there are clearly separated regions hosting spiral waves interspersed with featureless, laminar patches. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/rei900_snapshots.pdf}
    \caption{RMS velocity perturbations in the $z-\theta$ plane at $r=R_{mid}$ for $\Reyn_i=900, \Reyn_0=-3398$. The upper left panel shows DNS, the upper right panel shows QL, and the remaining six are GQL with $\Lambda = 1,3,5,10, 30, 60$. Until $\Lambda > 30$, spiral turbulence is not apparent.}
    \label{fig:rei900_snapshots}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:ke_vs_t_rei900} shows the kinetic energy as a function of time and $\Lambda$ for both the supercritical (left) and subcritical (right) runs. 
The supercritical case shows significant oscillations at all $\Lambda < 30$.
While both $\Lambda = 30$ and 60 show spiral turbulence, $\Lambda=30$ has considerably more wave motion in the laminar region than either $\Lambda = 60$ or DNS. 
Interestingly, figure~\ref{fig:ke_vs_t_rei900} shows that $\Lambda=30$ has a \emph{lower} kinetic energy much closer to that of DNS than does $\Lambda=60$.

By examining power spectra in figure~\ref{fig:rei900_spectra}, we begin to see the reason for the more complex flows seen with $\Lambda > 0$. Even low-order non-linear scatter leads to a steady increase to higher $k$ and $m$. The spectra of $\Lambda = 30$ and 60 are of particular interest in understanding the nature of spiral turbulence: they show a transition toward filamentary structure aligned along the diagonal, very similar to DNS. The square feature clearly visible at $\Lambda = 60$ is analogous to similar structures seen in channel flow turbulence (see figure 4.20 of \cite{2019Kellam}). In that work, the author proposed a potential explanation in terms of the linear instability of the non-linear solution: assume there is an instability of the mean $(m, k_z) = (0,0)$ at some wavenumber $k'$. If $k'$ is counted among the high modes, high-low $\to$ high interactions smoothly populate the high modes. However, as $\Lambda$ increases, it reaches a point at which the last unstable mode $k'$ becomes counted among the low modes. Because low-low $\to$ high interactions are truncated in GQL,  this results in a sudden decrease in the amount of energy available in the high part of the spectrum. Reference \cite{2019Kellam} constructs a preliminary model of this behaviour for plane channel flow and finds support for the idea.

Starting from a saturated spiral turbulence state from DNS at $t/\tau_\nu \simeq 1.5$ (upper), $t/\tau_\nu \simeq 3$ (lower), we continue the solution with QL ($\Lambda = 0$) and GQL with cutoffs $\Lambda = 1,3,5,10,30,60$. At higher $\Reyn_i$, all of the reduced models except $\Lambda = 60$ begin high amplitude oscillations. At lower $\Reyn_i$, $\Lambda = 60$ is required to maintain the spiral turbulence state. }

The figure shows only the lowest 100 modes in each direction, though in the simulations $|k_{max}| = 256$ and  $m_{max} = 511$.}
    \label{fig:rei900_spectra}
\end{figure}
Focusing on $\Lambda=5$, figure~\ref{fig:rei900_lambda5_story} shows that the flow goes through a series of different states bearing a strong resemblance to other well-known TC flow patterns originally identified in exhaustive series of experiments reported in \cite{1984JFM...146...45M} and subsequently found in simulations (e.g. \cite{2009PhRvE..80d6315M}). At the time of kinetic energy minimum, labelled 1 in the left hand side of figure~\ref{fig:rei900_lambda5_story}, the flow seems to recapitulate the interpenetrating spirals (IPS) characteristic of lower $\Reyn$ counter-rotating flows. As the kinetic energy rises, reaching a knee at point 2, the flow morphology resembles the patchy bursts characteristic of the intermittency regime (INT). Finally, at the peak of the kinetic energy oscillation, point 3 in figure~\ref{fig:rei900_lambda5_story}, the flow reaches its closest approach to something resembling spiral turbulence, though it is very difficult to identify the flow as such from a slice at a single point in time and plane in space.

This is notable for a few reasons. At $\Reyn_i=900, \Reyn_o=-3398$ the system is not in a hysteretic region of parameter space. Thus, we do not expect this behaviour to be due to GQL picking up other, coexisting solutions. 
It also highlights the delicate balance an intermittent laminar/turbulent solution represents. The turbulence in this solution has a very broad range of scales, as evidenced by figure~\ref{fig:urms_tz_rei700}. Understanding how it exchanges energy with the mean flow is crucial to understanding both the saturation of the underlying linear instability as well as the maintenance of the non-linear state.

At the kinetic energy minimum (point 1), the flow shows a IPS-like morphology, while an INT burst occurs at the knee (point 2), and a more space-filling turbulent state occurs at maximum energy (point 3).}

Finally, in figure~\ref{fig:rei900_vmean}, we show the azimuthal velocity averaged over $\theta$ and $z$, giving the mean deviation from CCF as a function of GQL cutoff $\Lambda$. Note that no conditional averaging \cite{2009PhRvE..80f7301D} is performed here, so this represents an average over both laminar and turbulent regions for DNS. As $\Lambda$ is increased, the profile approaches the DNS case; this is typical of GQL behaviour (figure 7 of \cite{2017JFM...810..412T} shows the same for rotating plane Couette flow). However, QL performs slightly better than low order GQL with $\Lambda < 5$.

\subsection{Subcritical spiral turbulence}
In order to study subcritical spiral turbulence, we ran a series of DNS with decreasing $\Reyn_i$. Each is initialised with the last timestep of the prior run and run for one viscous time. Once we reached $\Reyn_i = 700$, we run a DNS for a final viscous time and then repeat the procedure from the supercritical GQL study. The right panel of figure~\ref{fig:ke_vs_t_rei900} shows  that all $\Lambda < 30$ revert to the laminar state within $0.1 \tau_\nu$. At $\Lambda = 30$, the solution recovers from the decay and begins to climb in energy again but ultimately returns to the laminar CCF state. Curiously, our $\Lambda = 60$ run not only remains in a non-laminar solution for as long as we have been able to run for, it also correctly reproduces the spiral turbulence pattern, just as in the supercritical case. 

The ability of GQL to reproduce spiral turbulence in the subcritical regime is quite significant. First, while $\Lambda = 60$ corresponds to the fully non-linear interactions occurring in a rather large fraction of the total number of modes in the simulation, it is important to note that a DNS at $n_\theta = n_z = 60$ would be massively underresolved, possibly numerically unstable. Second, the ability of non-linear interactions to sustain turbulence where non-normal linear dynamics alone cannot suggests an important role for exact coherent states in subcritical Taylor-Couette flow. Because GQL retains all linear dynamics and low-order non-linear couplings, in addition to the couplings between the mean flows and high modes, if non-normal dynamics played a strong role in subcritical turbulence, one would expect the behavior seen at $\Lambda = 30$ to lead to sustained, rather than transient turbulence. 

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We have presented a series of simulations demonstrating the performance of GQL at various cutoffs for Taylor-Couette flow in the spiral turbulence regime. GQL is a significant improvement over QL models in representing statistical quantities, particularly the power spectra. However, it does not retain an unambiguous spiral form in the supercritical regime until $\Lambda \simeq 30$; at subcritical $\Reyn_i$, $\Lambda \simeq 60$ is required to see any sustained flows at all. Interestingly, when GQL solutions do sustain non-CCF flows in the subcritical regime, they also produce spiral patterns. Prior work has focused on the utility of GQL in presenting a more accurate \emph{statistical} picture of turbulent flows than QL \cite{2016PhRvL.116u4501M, 2017JFM...810..412T,2018RSPSA.47480422T,2019Kellam}. This focus is particularly important in light of its potential as a means of improving the accuracy of direct statistical simulation (DSS), a method for studying turbulence by computing its statistics directly, rather than individual realisations \cite{2022arXiv220505513M}. 
We have shown here that it is possible to use GQL as a means to investigate the non-linear interactions of greatest importance for maintaining the intricate patterns manifested in Taylor-Couette flow. In future work, we will consider the ability of GQL to maintain exact coherent states identified by Deguchi et al \cite{2014PhRvL.112r4502D} and the dynamics of which were studied recently by Wang and coworkers \cite{2022arXiv220712990W}. Understanding how these interactions work to shape subcritical TC turbulence represents a promising new avenue to understanding how ECS are maintained and how they in turn sustain turbulence below linear stability bounds. In particular, one can begin to understand the relative importance of non-normal effects (represented entirely with GQL) and non-linear ECS.
